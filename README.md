# 👋 Hi, I'm Krzysztof Ksiezyc

### ⚽ Football Data Analyst & Data Science Enthusiast  
### 📊 Deep Learning • LSTM • Match Evaluation Models • Python & R

I am passionate about **football analytics**, **data science**, and **modelling player performance with machine learning**.  
My work focuses on applying deep learning — especially **LSTM models** — to real football match data.

In 2025, I defended my Master’s thesis on:

> **Valuation and match-rating of football players using an LSTM model (case study: Wisła Kraków)**

I have completed multiple professional football-analytics projects, ranging from player evaluation systems to advanced time-series modelling of match events.

I also regularly publish **football analytics & machine learning articles on Medium**, where I break down models, methodologies and applied ML techniques:

Beyond sports analytics, I have experience in **data analysis, econometrics, Python, R, SQL, Power BI and Tableau**.
